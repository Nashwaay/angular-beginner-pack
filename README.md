## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Exrecise
Modify or add a feature to improve the web app
- [ ] Edit a wish item
- [ ] Mark strikethrough for completed wishes
- [ ] Add a new routing page

Also modify the existing code to clear the input box once the item is added in the list!

Happy Angular Coding!
